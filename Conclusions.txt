1. Introduction:

My 'ConFusion' project is the heart and face of Con-Fusion restaurant.
The Single Page Application representing the main details of the restaurant such as menu in the Menu page and location and phone number in the Contact Us page, 
though not forgetting the customer side in the Feedback form.
The application contains:
- services
- routs
- using animation module
- using REST
- tests tools


2. Post Request - When i have to get a response from the server after posting, i concidered to use a promise instead of subscribe.
